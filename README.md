BACKGROUND 

Catan (www.catan.com) is a board game in which players strategize where to build 
developments in order to obtain needed resources. The board is variable, made up of 
19 hexes representing different terrains, so the game is different every time it's played. 
However, the Building Costs cards are always the same for all players - these are basically 
recipe cards telling you what resources you need in order to build a road, settlement, or city, 
or to purchase a development card. All players, for example, need 1 Lumber card and 1 Brick card
to build a road. We thought it might be interesting to see what happens when each player has 
their own unique building requirements. 

Hence, I've made catancard, a simple web app to generate random Building Costs cards. 

IMPROVEMENT 

There are lots of changes planned: 
* 4 different cards, instead of 1
* ability to print a PDF of the 4 cards
* improved graphics and formatting 
* a refresh button, rather than having to reload the page
* et cetera!
