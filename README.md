BACKGROUND 
----------

[Settlers of Catan](www.catan.com) is a board game in which players strategize where to build settlements in order to obtain needed resources. The board is variable, made up of 19 hexagon tiles representing 6 different terrains, so the game is different every time it's played. However, the Building Costs cards are always the same for all players - these are basically recipe cards telling you what resources you need in order to build a road, settlement, or city, or to purchase a development card. All players, for example, need 1 Lumber card and 1 Brick card to build a road.

We thought it might be interesting to see what happens when each player has their own unique building requirements. Hence, I made catancard, a simple web app to generate random Building Costs cards. 

PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------

There are lots of changes planned: 
* ~~4 different cards, instead of 1~~
* ability to print a PDF of the 4 cards
* improved graphics and formatting
* ~~a refresh button~~
* refactoring
* et cetera!
